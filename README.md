## Basic Overview of Project

The goal of the project is to make a working web api, that will quiz the user on the subject of Final Fantasy 14.  
This program will be reactive to allow a timed quiz starting on a start button and have a user interface where they can click buttons to answer questions.  
Once all questions are answered or time runs out, the user will be scored.
The user can enter their information for the past scores screen.
Writing of questions are based off of the 5.3 patch, or patch of question will be said in question.

## Further Development Plans

If I have more time later, would like to have a the score be ordered by values (sorting array function).  Also would like to add local data storage with a clear scores function.
