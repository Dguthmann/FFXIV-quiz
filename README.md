## Basic Overview of Project

The goal of the project is to make a working web api, that will quiz the user on the subject of Final Fantasy 14.  
This program will be reactive to allow a timed quiz starting on a start button and have a user interface where they can click buttons to answer questions.  
Once all questions are answered or time runs out, the user will be scored.
The user can enter their information for the high score screen.
